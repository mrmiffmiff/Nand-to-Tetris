# NAND2Tetris #

The point of this repository is to document my work on Nand2Tetris as described in the Coursera courses of that name and the book _The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer From First Principles_ by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. This repository only contains my projects; any tools or documentation files from the course itself are not included as there is no need for them to take up space here when they are freely available, nor are my notes included as they are structured in a way personal to me and the course is also available with relative ease.
